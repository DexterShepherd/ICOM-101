### Course Description

This course provides an introduction to practical web development for artists.
Each student will learn the basics of HTML and CSS, and how to combine them into
a functioning portfolio website. Students will learn how to work with rich media
sources, create dynamic animations, and deploy content to the web using free and open
source tools. The final project in this course is to have a personal website set
up and running.


### Materials
- Equipment
  - A computer with internet access
- Software  
  _we will install these together as the course progresses_
  - A programming focused text editor of your choice ( I recomend VSCode, Atom, or Sublime Text )
  - A modern web browser ( Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge )
  - Node.js

### Expected expenses
Purchasing a domain name to use as your website url is an optional, but strongly encouraged part of this course.
Domain name costs vary depending on TLD ( .com, .me, .party, etc ) and some other factors, but most personal
website domains come in at under $10 per year.
