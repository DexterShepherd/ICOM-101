          <h5 class='underline'>Simple Static Sites</h5>
          <p>Sites that act as a hub for content, but don't always host the content themselves.</p>
          <p>
            We are less interested in building fully featured, rich media browsing portfolios, and more concerned with creating useful directories linking to content around the web.

            <p>Visiting a website is a lot like calling someone on the phone. Every website on the internet has a unique <strong>IP Address</strong>, like a phone number, that points to the server where that website is being hosted.</p>
            <p>The <strong>DNS</strong> acts like your address book and maps website names to website addresses.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>If you know the IP address of a website, you can bypass the DNS completely.</p>

          <p>The DNS looks up the domain name you have requested, and returns the IP address of that website to your ISP</p>

          <h3>Server</h3>
          <img src="https://raymondc.net/assets/img/nocloud.png" alt="">
          <p>A server is the computer that hosts your website. Servers make the internet work, but in this class we will avoid dealing with them directly wherever possible.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Client</h3>
          <p>The client refers to the computer that is visiting your website ( the opposite of the server ). All the code we write will be executed on the client.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Front end / Back end ( server side / client side )</h3>
          <p> The front end and back end refer to the client and server side respectively.  </p>
          <p> ex: "HTML is a <em>front end</em> language"</p>
